🏥 AI Insurance Cost Prediction
🌐 Live : https://insurance-cost-prediction-ml-akif-pgnh.onrender.com/
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Machine Learning web application that predicts medical insurance costs based on user input features such as age, BMI, smoking status, number of children, gender, and region.

The model is built using Random Forest Regressor, which provides high accuracy and handles non-linear relationships effectively.

The application is deployed using Flask and can be accessed via a web interface where users enter their details to get predicted insurance charges.

🚀 Technologies Used
	•	Python
	•	Pandas & NumPy
	•	Scikit-learn
	•	RandomForestRegressor
	•	Flask
	•	HTML & CSS
	•	Render (Deployment)


📊 Machine Learning Model
	•	Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor
	•	Type: Supervised Learning (Regression)
	•	Evaluation Metrics:
	•	R² Score
	•	MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
	•	RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

Random Forest was chosen because:
	•	It reduces overfitting
	•	Handles non-linear data well
	•	Provides better performance compared to simple Linear Regression

🧠 Input Features
	•	Age
	•	Gender
	•	BMI
	•	Number of Children
	•	Smoking Status
	•	Region

🖥️ How It Works
	1.	User enters details in the web form.
	2.	Flask receives input data.
	3.	Data is preprocessed.
	4.	Trained Random Forest model predicts insurance cost.
	5.	Predicted result is displayed on the webpage.
	
i. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to understand the linear relationship between independent variables and insurance charges. Smoking status showed the highest   positivecorrelation, indicating strong impact on medical expenses.

ii. Chi-Square test of independence was applied to categorical features after binning the target variable into quartiles. Features with p-value < 0.05 were retained for model training.

🔮 Future Improvements
	•	Add model comparison (Linear Regression vs Random Forest)
	•	Add feature importance visualization
	•	Improve UI design
	•	Add API endpoint

🎯 Conclusion

This project demonstrates practical implementation of Machine Learning using Random Forest for regression problems and deployment of ML models using Flask.

It is a complete end-to-end ML project from data preprocessing to deployment.
